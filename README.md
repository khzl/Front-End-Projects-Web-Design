💡 Learning Highlights
Responsive Design
Projects like “Tech Hub Roadmap” and “University HTML & CSS” showcase CSS Grid and Flexbox usage for responsive layouts.

Form & Login UI
Interactive and visually styled forms provide practice space for input validation and CSS pseudo-classes.

JSON Rendering
Basic JavaScript usage for rendering dynamic content from .json files builds practical scripting experience.

Creative Experiments
Folders with “Test” in the name are sandbox areas—designed for prototyping and tinkering.
